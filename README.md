# üß† Quote Generation Web App using DeepSeek R1

This project demonstrates a generative AI model fine-tuned to create meaningful and inspirational quotes based on user input text. The model is served through a simple and elegant **Streamlit** web interface.

## üîç Overview

Using the **DeepSeek R1 (7B)** large language model, we fine-tuned it on a curated dataset of quotes via **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**. The goal is to showcase how transfer learning can help adapt a pre-trained model for creative generation tasks.

Users can interact with the trained model through a web interface, enter a topic or phrase, and receive a uniquely generated quote in return.
